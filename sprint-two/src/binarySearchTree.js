// a binary search tree (BST), sometimes also called an ordered or sorted
// binary tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node
// has a comparable key (and an associated value) and satisfies the
// restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all
// nodes in that node's left subtree and smaller than the keys in all
// nodes in that node's right sub-tree.

// The common properties of binary search trees are as follows:[1]

// * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
// * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
// * The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
// * Each node can have up to two successor nodes.
// * There must be no duplicate nodes.
// * A unique path exists from the root to every other node.
